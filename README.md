Pet project for BeeWi car controlling @YPlan

It's not interesting when it's only work and no pleasure, so we got a [BeeWi Mini Cooper](http://www.bee-wi.com/bluetooth-controlled-car,us,4,BBZ251-A6.cfm) [@YPlan](http://yplanapp.com) to shorten those "hard" days :)<br />

It's a nice toy, and best of all - it is bluetooth controlled over iPhone! All you need is free [iOS application](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/beewi-control-pad/id427936738?mt=8). After few drag races with our designer [Jo√£o Pires](https://twitter.com/joaorafaelpires) we started to chat how it would be cool to mod it. You know... like add blinking lights, WiFi camera and etc, and best of all - I can write iOS application to do all that!

First of all I had to figure out how to send signals to [BeeWi Mini Cooper](http://www.bee-wi.com/bluetooth-controlled-car,us,4,BBZ251-A6.cfm) over bluetooth. Apparently it's quite simple. You just need to add `UISupportedExternalAccessoryProtocols` to `Info.plist` and connect to it using [ExternalAccessory.framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/ExternalAccessory/Reference/ExternalAccessoryFrameworkReference/_index.html) I got `UISupportedExternalAccessoryProtocols` from [official App](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/beewi-control-pad/id427936738?mt=8) by extracting IPA and poking in their own `Info.plist`. I was about to start sniff bluetooth data by emulating car, to check what data comes in to control it, but surprisingly found another project on GitHub that already did that [@hdi-95 hdi-remotepad](https://github.com/hdi-95/hdi-remotepad). That was pretty simple. Apparently you need only 8 command `0`-`7`. <br />
  * `0` - Stop go forward
  * `1` - Go forward
  * `2` - Stop go backwards
  * `3` - Go backwards
  * `4` - Stop turn Left
  * `5` - Turn Left
  * `6` - Stop Turn Right
  * `7` - Turn Right

BeeWi Mini Cooper - Hardware

Ok. So I need more of those signals to run on and of lights. Disassembling is quite easy. There is only 4 screws at the bottom. <br />
